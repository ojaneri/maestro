## Current Status

**Version 1.5** - Production Ready

The system is stable and suitable for production use with multiple concurrent instances. All core features are implemented and tested.

## Known Issues

- Minor: WebSocket reconnection issues in unstable network conditions
- Minor: Memory usage monitoring needed for long-running instances
- Minor: Rate limiting not fully implemented for API endpoints

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Database Migration**: Moved from JSON files to SQLite in v1.0 for better data consistency and concurrent access
- **Architecture Shift**: Adopted PHP + Node.js architecture for better separation of concerns
- **User Management**: Added multi-user support in v1.5 to enable team collaboration
- **AI Integration**: Expanded from basic OpenAI to support multiple providers (OpenAI, Gemini)
- **Calendar Integration**: Added Google Calendar support for advanced scheduling features
- **Security**: Implemented API key authentication and role-based access control
